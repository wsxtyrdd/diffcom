## Abstract

End-to-end visual communication systems typically optimize a trade-off between channel bandwidth costs and signal-level
distortion metrics. However, under challenging physical conditions, this traditional coding and transmission paradigm
often results in unrealistic reconstructions with perceptible blurring and aliasing artifacts, despite the inclusion of
perceptual or adversarial losses for optimizing. This issue primarily stems from the receiverâ€™s limited knowledge about
the underlying data manifold and the use of deterministic decoding mechanisms. 
To address these limitations, this paper
introduces DiffCom, a novel end-to-end generative communication paradigm that utilizes off-the-shelf generative priors
and probabilistic diffusion models for decoding, thereby improving perceptual quality without heavily relying on
bandwidth costs and received signal quality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on deterministic decoders optimized
solely for distortion metrics, our DiffCom leverages raw channel-received signal as a fine-grained condition to guide
stochastic posterior sampling. Our approach ensures that reconstructions remain on the manifold of real data with a
novel confirming constraint, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the generated outcomes.

TODO: provide implementations of DiffCom based on \`SwinJSCC\` and \`NTSCC+\`.

## Inference Code

```bash
python main_diffcom.py --opt ./configs/diffcom.yaml
```

Please check the `diffcom.yaml` file for more details. 
The codebase now supports `diffcom`, `hifi_diffcom`, and `blind_diffcom`.

You can change the hyperparameters in the YAML file to run the corresponding method.
